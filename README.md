# LibraryUX
===========
## AKA: BibliUx

This is a project developed to determine the usability of a determined library's landing page.

The company's desired output is quite specific:
They'd like a webpage that both gives users a bit of insight into what makes for good UX practices and at the same time, would like a database to store and persist ranking data.
The page uses Angular 6's i18n for internationalization purposes.
